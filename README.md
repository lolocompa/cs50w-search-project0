# CS50W Search Project

- **Google Image Search**: A dedicated interface for searching images through Google, offering a streamlined experience for finding images.
- **Google Advanced Search**: An advanced search form that enables users to refine their search queries with specific parameters, such as searching for exact phrases, excluding certain words, and more.
